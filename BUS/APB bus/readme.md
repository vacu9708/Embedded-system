The APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) is part of the AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) suite of protocols.<br>
AMBA is a widely used interconnection standard for connecting functional blocks (like CPUs, memory units, and peripherals).
- **Purpose**: APB is designed for low-bandwidth control accesses, for example, peripheral device control. Its primary use is to connect simple peripherals to the primary bus, which could be an AHB (Advanced High-performance Bus) or AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface) bus in the AMBA standard.
- **Simplicity and Efficiency**: The APB is simpler compared to other buses in the AMBA family. It is optimized for minimal power consumption and reduced complexity of peripherals. This makes it ideal for simple, lower-speed tasks where high throughput is not a critical requirement.
- **Use Cases**: APB is commonly used for interfacing with low-speed peripherals like keyboards, mouse devices, UARTs, SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) controllers(control signals don't require high speed).
