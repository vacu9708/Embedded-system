AXI is designed to provide a high-performance communication interface between hardware components.

## Key features of AXI
- **High Performance**: Supports high-speed data transfer and efficient communication between different parts of a system.
- **Separate Read and Write Channels**: It has independent channels for read and write operations, enhancing throughput and efficiency.
- **Support for Burst Transfers**: AXI allows burst-based transfers, which is efficient for moving large blocks of data.
- **Flexible and Scalable**: It's adaptable to various types of implementations and can be scaled according to the system requirements.
- **Out-of-Order Transaction(pipeline)**: This feature allows for more efficient use of the bus, as transactions can complete in any order, not necessarily the order they were initiated.
- **Spport for Multiple Masters and Slaves**: AXI can handle communication between multiple master and slave devices, making it suitable for complex SoC (System on Chip) designs.
