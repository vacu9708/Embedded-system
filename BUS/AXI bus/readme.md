AXI is designed to provide a high-performance communication interface between hardware components.

## Key features of the AXI bus protocol include:
- **Support for multiple channels**: AXI supports multiple channels for data transfers, such as read and write channels, which allows for concurrent data transactions.
- **Separate address and data phases**: AXI separates the address and data phases of transactions, making it possible to initiate data transfers without waiting for the entire address phase to complete.
- **Burst transfers**: AXI supports burst data transfers, where multiple data elements can be transferred in a single transaction, improving data transfer efficiency.
- **Support for pipelining**: AXI can be pipelined to further improve data throughput in high-performance systems.
- **Out-of-order execution**: AXI allows for out-of-order execution(pipeline) of transactions, which can enhance system performance by allowing transactions to proceed independently when possible.
