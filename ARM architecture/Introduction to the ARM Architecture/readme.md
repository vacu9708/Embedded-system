# Introduction to the ARM Architecture

## Overview
The ARM architecture is a dominant force in various market segments due to its simplicity, efficiency, and low power consumption. It's a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture, known for its:
- Large uniform register file.
- Load/store architecture.
- Simple addressing modes.
- Uniform and fixed-length instruction fields.

## Key Features
- **Performance**: Supports a wide spectrum of performance points.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Ideal for devices requiring low energy use.
- **Implementation Size**: Small, leading to less power consumption.
- **Balance**: Offers a good balance of performance, code size, power consumption, and silicon area.

## ARM Architecture Characteristics
- **RISC Core**: Reduced Instruction Set Computing principles.
- **Enhancements**: Includes ALU and shifter control, auto-increment/decrement addressing, Load and Store Multiple instructions, and conditional execution.

## ARM Registers (A1.1.1)
- **Total**: 31 general-purpose 32-bit registers.
- **Visible Registers**: 16 at any time, with others aiding in exception processing.
- **User Mode**: Unprivileged, with limited access compared to privileged modes.
- **Special Registers**:
  - R13: Stack Pointer (SP).
  - R14: Link Register (LR).
  - R15: Program Counter (PC).

## Exceptions (A1.1.2)
- **Types**: Seven types, each with a dedicated privileged mode.
- **Banked Registers**: Specific registers for each exception mode.
- **Modes**: Includes IRQ, FIQ, and System modes.

## Status Registers (A1.1.3)
- **CPSR**: Current Program Status Register, holding processor status and condition flags.
- **SPSR**: Saved Program Status Register, for storing CPSR of the task before the exception.

## ARM Instruction Set (A1.2)
Broadly categorized into:
- **Branch Instructions**: For control flow alteration.
- **Data-processing Instructions**: Arithmetic, logic, and comparison operations.
- **Status Register Transfer Instructions**: Transfer between CPSR/SPSR and general-purpose registers.
- **Load and Store Instructions**: Data movement between registers and memory.
- **Coprocessor Instructions**: Data processing, transfer, and register operations specific to coprocessors.
- **Exception-generating Instructions**: SWI for software interrupts, BKPT for breakpoints.

### Key Points
- **Conditional Execution**: Almost all instructions can execute based on condition codes.
- **Branch Instructions**: Include standard branches, subroutine calls, and set switching (ARM, Thumb, Jazelle).
- **Data-processing Instructions**: Arithmetic/logic, comparisons, SIMD, multiplies, and miscellaneous.

## Thumb Instruction Set (A1.3)
- A 16-bit subset of the 32-bit ARM instruction set, offering code density improvements.
