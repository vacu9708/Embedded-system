# Introduction to the ARM Architecture
## A1.1 About the ARM architecture

### Key Characteristics
ARM is a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (**RISC**) architecture, which includes:
- Large uniform register file.(In ARM's RISC architecture, there is a large set of registers, which are small, fast storage locations within the CPU. These registers are uniform, meaning they can all be used interchangeably for a wide range of instructions. This uniformity simplifies the instruction set and improves the speed of computation.)
- Load/store architecture.(Data-processing operations (like addition, subtraction, etc.) are performed only on data in the registers, not directly on data in memory.)
- Simple addressing modes.(Addressing modes refer to the ways in which instructions specify the location of data. The smaller number of simple addressing modes makes it easier to design the hardware to decode and execute instructions, which can lead to faster processing speeds.)
- Uniform and fixed-length instruction fields, to simplify instruction decode.(to facilitate pipeline)

### Enhancements
- Control over the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and shifter.
- Auto-increment and auto-decrement addressing modes.
- Load and Store Multiple instructions.
- Conditional execution of almost all instructions.
These enhancements to a basic RISC architecture allow ARM processors to achieve a good balance of high performance, small code size, low power consumption, and small silicon area.

### Coprocessor
Coprocessors can be attached to the ARM processor. A coprocessor extends the processing features of a core by extending the instruction set or by providing configuration registers.

## A1.1.1 ARM Registers
- Total of 37 registers
  - 31 general-purpose 32-bit registers, including a program counter. R0 ~ R15 visible at any time.
  - 6 status registers

## A1.1.2 Exceptions
- **Types of Exceptions:**
  - reset
  - attempted execution of an Undefined instruction
  - software interrupt (SWI) instructions, can be used to make a call to an operating system
  - Prefetch Abort, an instruction fetch memory abort
  - Data Abort, a data access memory abort
  - IRQ, Interrupt request
  - FIQ, Fast interrupt request

## A1.1.3 Status Registers

All processor state other than the general-purpose register contents is held in status registers.
- **Current Program Status Register (CPSR):** Holds processor status, condition code flags, interrupt disable bits, processor mode, etc.
- **Saved Program Status Register (SPSR):** Holds the CPSR of the task before an exception occurred. (Each exception mode has SPSR) 

## A1.2 ARM Instruction Set
### Classification
1. **Branch Instructions**
2. **Data-Processing Instructions**
3. **Status Register Transfer Instructions**
4. **Load and Store Instructions**
5. **Coprocessor Instructions**
6. **Exception-Generating Instructions**

### Features
- Conditional execution based on condition code flags.
- Most data-processing instructions can update the CPSR flags.

## A1.2.1 Branch Instructions
Used for control flow alteration by writing the PC(Program Counter)
- **Standard Branch Instruction:** Uses a 24-bit signed word offset for forward and backward branches.
- **Branch and Link (BL):** Preserves return address in the Link Register.
- **Instruction Set Switching:** Allows switching between ARM and Thumb instruction sets.

## A1.2.2 Data-Processing Instructions
- **Arithmetic/Logic Instructions:** Perform operations on two source operands and write the result.
- **Comparison Instructions:** Perform operations without writing the result, just updating condition flags.
- **SIMD Instructions:** Treat operands as parallel 16-bit or 8-bit numbers (ARMv6).
- **Multiply Instructions:** Various classes for different operations.

## A1.2.3 Status Register Transfer Instructions
- **Function:** Transfer contents between CPSR/SPSR and general-purpose registers.

## A1.2.4 Load and Store Instructions
Move data between memory and registers.
- **Types:** Regular, Multiple registers, Exclusive.
- **Addressing Modes:** Offset, Pre-indexed, Post-indexed.
- **Support for Unaligned Accesses:** Introduced in ARMv6.

## A1.2.5 Coprocessor Instructions
- **Types:** Data-processing, Data transfer, Register transfer.

## A1.2.6 Exception-Generating Instructions
- **Software Interrupt (SWI):** Used for OS-defined services(software interrupt).
- **Software Breakpoint (BKPT):** Causes an abort exception for debugging.

## A1.3 Thumb Instruction Set
A subset of ARM instruction set with 16-bit encoding for instructions.
It offers code density improvements.(Code density refers to the amount of instructions that can be packed into a given amount of memory space.)
